    "snippet": "My Non-Alcoholic Beer JourneyIn November 2010 I had my last alcoholic drink and in the last 10+ years the world of non-alcoholic beers has come on leaps and bounds.So here is a story of my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey as I have taken at least one picture of every beer (50 at time of writing) I have had over the years, but have 100s of pictures in my non alcoholic beer album on google photos and the most photographed beer in my collection is Heineken Zero.With most of the beers there is a story, others only worthy of a couple of lines but each given a score out of 10 and as I try new ones they will be added to the list and from 2021 onwards I will be reviewing them as close to trying as possible Techniques for non-alcoholic beersInterestingly I have learnt a little about how non alcoholic beers are made in most cases the beer is brewed normally and then the alcohol is taken out but most breweries keep their exact technique secret, but below are the 4 most common techniques to produce a non-alcoholic beer which is defined as having 0.5% ABV or less are:      Reverse osmosis: is a water purification process that uses a partially permeable membrane to separate ions, unwanted molecules and larger particles in the case of beer the alcohol and water is removed, leaving a concentrated version of the beer, the water is then added back without the alcohol.        Limited Fermentation: alcohol in beer is produced during fermentation, when yeast breaks down the sugar, this can be done in a variety of different waysLimiting Fermentable Sugars: Using grains that produce less fermentable sugars or techniques that limit the sugars from the grains in the mashing process.Special Yeast Strains: Some yeast strains will naturally produce less alcohol on fermentation but this may leave you more sugars in the final beer or other leave the beer with a sour taste.Blocking Fermentation: By changing the environment (eg temperature, acidity) during fermentation can either stop or slow down the process leaving less alcohol but you may be left with a sweeter or “unfinished” tasting beer.        Watering Down: So rather than removing the alcohol you dilute the finished beer with water, with this process you need to make a concentrate beer first.        Avoid Fermentation: By not fermenting the beer you avoid creating the alcohol but you also avoid doing what makes a beer a beer but producers tweak the production process to create a drink that looks and tastes like a beer.  Below is a link to more details on each of the beers I have tried. (I can’t confirm for definite that I have tried a beer from each of the 4 techniques above but I know for definite I have tried a reverse osmosis and avoid fermentation) My Top Ranked Beers                   Peroni Libera 0.0%              So after my first try of non alcoholic beer in 2007 it took 12 years for me to find a beer worthy of a full 10/10. I spotted it on a random trip to Tesco and even though it was more expensive than any of the previous 30+ beers, I had to give it a try.                                         1                    My Rating: 10/10                                    San Miguel 0,0              So a family trip to Ibiza in 2014 and one of the best non-alcoholic beers. I am not sure if the sun was a factor or that it tasted just like the real San Miguel but it was almost like the best beer I had tasted for such a long time, but my early relationship with San Miguel 0,0 was cut short after a week in Ibiza.                                         2                    My Rating: 9.5/10                                    Heineken Zero (Draught)              It was Christmas Eve as I walked into the pub I noticed Heineken Zero was available on draught what a early Christmas present my first ever pint of non-alcoholic beer!!!                                        3                    My Rating: 9.5/10                                    Heineken Zero              Another road trip this time to the south of France and a stop over in central France for the night delivered another new beer and one that now is a staple in my non-alcoholic beer journey as its available widely in the UK and is the non-alcoholic beer in the new Tottenham hotspur stadium.                                         4                    My Rating: 9/10                                    Birra Moretti Zero              With the Drive behind me it was onto our first meal in Italy on the holiday and my first Italian non-alcoholic beer. This was the non-alcoholic beer I had been waiting for since San Miguel back in 2014.                                        5                    My Rating: 9/10                                My Other Ranked Beers                          6:        9/10               Days Lager                     7:        9/10               Free Star                     8:        9/10               Brewdog Lost AF                     9:        8/10               Holsten Alcohol-Free                     10:        8/10               Lucky Saint                     11:        8/10               Moritz 0,0                     12:        8/10               Sainsbury&#39;s Pilsner                     13:        8/10               Doom Bar Zero                     14:        8/10               Fresh Start                     15:        8/10               Bitburger Drive                     16:        7/10               Buckler Pur Malt                     17:        7/10               Cobra Zero                     18:        7/10               Rothaus - Hefe Weizen                     19:        7/10               Rothaus - Tannenzapfle                     20:        7/10               Veltins Alkoholfrei                     21:        7/10               Smashed Pale                     22:        7/10               Stella Artois                     23:        7/10               Leffe Blond 0,0                     24:        7/10               Bavaria Premium 0.0%                     25:        6/10               Free Damm                     26:        6/10               Brewdog Hazy AF                     27:        6/10               St Peters Original                     28:        6/10               Jever Fun                     29:        6/10               Brewdog Punk AF                     30:        6/10               Paulaner Alkoholfree                     31:        6/10               Amstel Bier 0.0%                     32:        6/10               Warsteiner Fresh 0.0%                     33:        6/10               Big Drop Pine Trail                     34:        6/10               No Worries                     35:        6/10               Clausthaler non-alcoholic                     36:        6/10               Becks Blue                     37:        5/10               1664 Sans Alcool Blonde                     38:        5/10               Ghost Ship 0.5%                     39:        5/10               Estrella Galicia 0.0%                     40:        5/10               Lager Blonde 0,0%                     41:        5/10               Furstenberg Pilsener 0,0%                     42:        5/10               Wieckse Radler 0,0%                     43:        5/10               Fruh Kolsch 0,0                     44:        5/10               Jupiler N.A                     45:        5/10               Carlsberg 0.0%                     46:        5/10               Feldschlosschen                     47:        5/10               Hoegaarden 0,0                     48:        4/10               Big Drop Uptown                     49:        4/10               Drink&#39;In the Sun                     50:        4/10               Beavertown Lazer Crush                     51:        4/10               San Miguel Manzana 0,0                     52:        4/10               Sport Zot                     53:        4/10               Wheest Dark Ale                     54:        4/10               Brooklyn Special Effects                     55:        4/10               Budweiser Prohibition                     56:        4/10               Budweiser Budvar B:Free                     57:        4/10               Brewdog Nanny State                     58:        4/10               Erdinger Alkoholfrei                     59:        4/10               Franziskaner Alkoholfrei                     60:        4/10               Scheniger Weisse                     61:        4/10               Bavaria Wit 0.0%                     62:        4/10               Wieckse Rose 0,0%                     63:        3/10               Nirvana Pale Ale 0.0%                     64:        3/10               Kronenbourg Pur Malt                     65:        3/10               Innis &amp;amp; None                     66:        3/10               Becks Blue Lemon                     67:        2/10               Big Drop Double Strike                     68:        1/10               Amstel 0.0% Grapefruit                     69:        1/10               Tiny Reel CLWB Tropica                     70:        0.5/10               Prestige Pur Malt &amp;lt;1%                     71:        0/10               Big Drop Galactic            "

The first taste was clean and crisp. And a hint of malt citrus aftertaste.After looking up Sessionable on google. {Adjective INFORMAL (of beer) relatively low in alcohol content and therefore suitable for drinking over an extended period}. After the first bottle I think this one could be good for a few in a session unlike some of the beers in the list that leave me bloated after just one or two.I have the Days Pale Ale to try next but this one makes it into the top 10 on my list at the time of writing. I am pleased I have some more in my beer cupboard to have at a later date, maybe a session rather than a random Thursday.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

Unfortunately I am glad that its Heiniken Zero at the stadium.This one lacked any real taste to me apart from a slight bitter after taste, which didn’t live up to the name or the great design on the can.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

There was a subtle cirtus flavour but not the lemon curd that was quoted on the bottle.Now this beer was meant to be a great gateway into the world of sour beers but this one might put me off going there but I will try anything once!Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

A sutle sweet smell when I poured and my wife stole the first sip and said this was nice and I would happily drink that.This was nice and refreshing with a smooth not overly fizzy taste, and you can certainly taste the added sugar almost a toffee like taste. All in all a nice pale ale that went down wellI will be looking at trying to find the two other offerings (Smashed Larger and Smashed Citrus) from Drinks Unlimited as this one has certainly wet my appetiteFollow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

So this one is based on Brewdog’s Lazy Lager which was this planet first German-style Pilsner is a 4.5% lager brewed using wind power, a third less water, and would-be waste bread in the malt bill.Now this was a lighter lager which I prefer with some citrus taste and mild malty bitterness that meant it went down really nicely. All this combining in my favourite offering from Brewdog so far with Nanny State coming in at 4/10, Punk AF coming in at 6/10If you know the mathmatician in me loves a good pattern so I was close to giving this one 8/10 but it deserved an extra 1 out of 10 as I will definately be getting Lost AF again as it ticked nearly all of my AF beer boxes!

I couldn’t tell you if there was corinander in there, the taste was pleasant with a slight bitterness on the end.Interestingly only 8 of the 60 beers have had sugar added and 4 of those including this one are from Belgium and I think this beer would go down well with a nice belgium waffle and ice cream, a refreshing drink but is it a beer?

To finally reward those who aren’t drinking with the beer they deserve.”So was it the beer I deserved as a non-alocholic beer drinker?

    "snippet": "So for my first book review I thought it was only right to review the book that I had rewritten a chapter in a community book “The Bounce Back Journey of Men’s Health” which was part of a trilogy of books where proceeds went to charity. Click here to find our moreBeing a lover of numbers writing a chapter to go into a book was a totally new and different challenge for me, especially as sharing my thoughts had always been difficult.Writing about my experiences helped me to become more open with sharing the way I am feeling, I still have a way to go on this but by sharing my experiences I hope it can help towards ending the stigma around mental health and inspire every to be more open about their feelings.However this book has become more than that for me since reading the stories of the other 17 authors and and hearing the inspiring stories first hand at the book launch I felt really privileged that my story was in this book.Each topic (including cancer, stroke, marriage breakdown, suicidal thoughts and abuse) within the book would be one that you wouldn’t normally associate with the “Man up” culture that still dominates in the world.I guarantee at least one of the stories (from any in the trilogy) will resonate with you and show people that things can get better after adversity.ThanksAnxious Accountant"

    "snippet": "Today is the deadline for us to complete our Self-Reflection on our performance management system at work and as I was self-reflecting on my performance at work for the year it made me realise that I have had a real journey the past 365 days personally as tomorrow marks the day from a year ago when I intended to take my own life.So 16th November 2018 was a turning point in my life and in my previous articles A new year actually does mean a new me and It&#39;s OK to not be OK! I have spoken about the my mental health openly which I would never have done before but even now I still find myself defaulting to being a closed book even with those closest to me when I am not OK but that&#39;s OK because I eventually remind myself to tell and this is something I am going to work on during the next part of my journey.However this article is more about the things I have done in the last 365 days as going back to the turning point I would never have imagined could have done anything and if anyone else out there feels suicidal it has shown me that it does get better.November 2018 and December 2018 are pretty much a blur but here is a list of things in 2019 that on self-reflection I&#39;m please I stayed around for I have probably forgotten some key ones but my memory isn&#39;t what it was:I started my phased returned to work in January 2019.5th January: Managed to make it to London to watch The Cursed Child for my Wife&#39;s birthday.13th January: I shared my first article on my mental health A new year actually does mean a new me.15th February: Had a weekend break in Torquay.2nd March : Took my son to his first North London derby.3rd April: I used my spurs season ticket for the first time for the very first game at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.22nd April: Went to Chessington for my Son&#39;s birthday!26th April: I went to see an ENT specialist after putting up with sinus problems for years (despite nearly fainting at the hospital), I got steroids from him which have really helped my sinuses!24th May: I went on holiday to St Ives in Cornwall with my Wife and my 2 youngest children. I felt bad on a couple of the days but enjoyed the time away.4th June: Went with my wife to see Hugh Jackman at the O2.14th June: Went to see Gazza and Vinnie Jones at the Oasis.26th June: I shared another article on my mental health It&#39;s OK to not be OK!23rd July: I was part of a presentation to our Group CFO on the UK IFRS 17 project.6th August: Had a short break to the Lake District.6th September: Met Ledley King at a Swindon Spurs legends night.9th September: I change my working hours by compressing my full time hours into 4 days.10th September: Booked a holiday to Florida for November 2020, just need to work on getting there unlike New York in 2018.11th September: I made a post about suicide prevention which got a lot of comments and messages, which has led to making a new friend from around the world.22nd September: Went on a mini-cruise but didn&#39;t see any of Belgium as I was in bed with a migraine.26th September: Met Gary Mabutt at a Swindon Town legends night.1st October: Delivered a training session on IFRS 17 to some senior finance execs.23rd October: Went to London so my Son could go on the last remaining tube lines he needed to go on!25th October: Went on a last minute break to Cornwall, wasn&#39;t feeling that great but spoke to my wife and she helped me deal with it!13th November: Went to the cinema with my wife without the kids!14th November: Helped deliver a training session on IFRS 17 to a number of finance team members.Now no list from an accountant can be complete without some numbers so here are a few about the last 365 days: 10 visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium gradually seeing worse performances each time luckily missing some of the worst performances through illness, an average of 2.5 visits to see a Doctor per month so much so the receptionists all know me well, getting to do the school run about 15% of the time, using our family national trust memberships to save over £300 on visits and parking and finally 4,048 deleted work emails since I have gone onto outlook!So what&#39;s next? I need to work on my anxiety around holidays and days out but looking back at this list is helpful in realising I can do all these things despite not being fully recovered from my mental health problems!And remember if you don&#39;t feel OK please tell someone!Thanks Andy"

    "snippet": "Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away after a weekend spent in bed with sickness and an upset stomach, which looks like it must have been something I ate as luckily nobody else in the family has come down with anything, so I took Monday off as I hadn’t really eaten anything.So feeling slightly more human yesterday morning I thought it would be a good idea to go back to work but not only was I still physically fragile let’s just say a little more mentally fragile than I could deal with, so for the first time in ages I cried at work (in the toilets) and then on the bus on the way home (when my wife messaged asking if I was OK after I said I was going home) and then again when I finally got home after the hottest bus ride ever (maybe more in relief that anything)So I keep myself busy working from home until lunch time and I have that hungry/nauseous feeling that you don’t know whether you are coming or going after you haven’t been feeling well, then eat some lunch, my stomach making some strange noises reminding me that my IBS hasn’t been out to play for a while, a quick walk and then home in time for another cry.Back to work and getting deep into the fun that is accounting for the Variable Fee Approach under IFRS 17 with profits contracts and keeping in touch with colleagues through Skype messages and that was the afternoon done until the kids get back from their dentist appointment which fortunately it wasn’t at two thirty!So on the work front a productive day and being in the lucky position that I can work from home helps, the distraction of work keeps the black dog at bay most of the time but it proves I still have a long way to go in my journey and I need to keep asking for help and I still find it hard to speak to people about my feelings, so writing them down is going to be a way of letting myself know it’s OKAY not to be OK and reminds me not to push myself too hard especially when I am not feeling physically well.Working at home again today just put this up in my lunch break as I’m about to take a little walk around the village still feeling nauseous but on the plus side no tears as yet!"

I spotted it on a random trip to Tesco and even though it was more expensive than any of the previous 30+ beers, I had to give it a try.Now I always liked a bottle of Peroni when in an Italian restaurant and the non-alcoholic lived up to the “good” old days.There is no downside to this beer for me as it isn’t overly carbonated, it has a nice light fruity taste and only a small about of bitterness coming through at the end. A really refreshing and easy to drink beer which is worth the premium price.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

    "snippet": "2018 was a difficult year for me (and those close to me), I didn&#39;t want to dwell on that too much but if it has taught me one thing it is I will never suffer in silence anymore and thought if anyone out there is reading this and suffering with a mental illness I hope they can learn from my experiences.I have found that &quot;I&#39;m fine&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m OK&quot;, &quot;Yes I can do that&quot;, &quot;No worries&quot; and things similar to that were something I said a lot last year (and throughout my life) and I would continue to put on the brave face even to those closest to me.Looking back when I was off with Anxiety and Depression in the summer for just over 3 weeks I returned to work not changing anything, not getting all the support I needed or knew I could get and putting that brave face on and it meant nothing had changed. But I was being told I was doing all the right things by my Doctor but can&#39;t help but think I wasn&#39;t telling them the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.So fast forward to October and living the lie finally caught up with me, I had hit rock bottom and didn&#39;t know where to turn and I thought I shouldn&#39;t be feeling like this I have a great wife, 3 lovely kids, a 5 bed detached house with a enjoyable career that I have worked hard to achieve . It was finally time to cry for help now I won&#39;t go into details but I didn&#39;t do it in the right way but it was the turning point that led me to get the help and supported I really needed, didn&#39;t know I could get or if I am being honest didn&#39;t want to look for as I thought I shouldn&#39;t need that help.So now those closest to me knew how bad I was, my wife sprang into action and her support was invaluable to get family around me (who I have been too proud to ask for help from) so I wasn&#39;t alone whilst she had to kept the day to day family life going and so not to impact on the kids.I always felt like I needed to be back at work as soon as I felt a little better as I hate having time off work sick, but this time was different with the support of my manager that pressure was taken away and gave me time to accept I have a mental illness and things had to change. I also found out that I was eligible through my work&#39;s private medical insurance I could receive 10 sessions with a private counselor and we had occupational health teams that we can work with to support your return to work.Now I am very lucky I work for a big company and I don&#39;t want to go political here but there just isn&#39;t enough money provided by the government to support mental health issues in the UK, my doctor&#39;s surgery (apart from one receptionist) has been fantastic for me but everything just takes so much time. Swindon is lucky to have the LIFT service (Lift Website) which provides great courses to help you manage things but I found when I was feeling bad and going to these courses I couldn&#39;t take anything in. Then the wait to see a LIFT practitioner one on one can be months and then you can only see them for a limited time and not regular enough as there are too many people suffering out there.So I felt I was ready to come back to work just before the Christmas break and it turned out that was perfect as I had a couple of days back in the office and managed to clear most of my 1500 emails I had received and meant when I came back in this year I was ready thanks to my manager and colleagues able to then have 100% focus on the IFRS 17 project which I never really had time to do in 2018 as other projects and business took my focus away and from speaking to my counselor maybe added to the my stress issues even though I had always said I made out that work wasn&#39;t an issue to everyone I spoke to and I couldn&#39;t say No as for some reason I have always wanted to please!As I am writing this I have managed 20 hours work last week as part of my phased return and there has been good days and not so good days but I am being open and honest to everyone who is willing to listen. So as I said at the start if all of the above has taught me one thing it is I will never suffer in silence anymore and if anyone out there is reading this and suffering with a mental illness please find someone to talk too!And finally here are a few other things that have help me other than the people around me:    Breathing (This is something that is always there and you can focus on your breathing as a way to distract from thoughts, but also I have been doing the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr Weil which is a simple portable stress antidote.)    Mediation (I have been using the Headspace app and this also has tools to help with sleep look here for more details www.headspace.com)    Reflexology (Not only for my Anxiety and Depression but for my sinuses, Reflexology is a relaxing foot (or hand) massage that works on the pressure points in the feet to stimulate and relax the internal organs, more information from my can be found here: http://reflexologyinoldtown.co.uk/)    Hypnotherapy (Now I was skeptical before this but it isn&#39;t like every time my wife clicks her fingers I now cluck like a chicken, the aim to a solution focused hypnotherapy which looks to make you feel more positive about life - more information from my hypnotherapist can be found here: https://joharrishypnotherapy.com/)    Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world (This is a book which is based on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy by Mark Williams and Danny Penman which my counselor recommended to me.)    Matt Haig (The books Reasons to Stay Alive and Notes on a Nervous Planet are a honest look at anxiety and depression, I also follow him on Twitter now.)    Not logging into Facebook.    Not looking at my phone in the bedroom.    Getting out of bed even when I don&#39;t feel like it!    Getting out the house even when I don&#39;t feel like it even if its just to go for a walk!    Walking.    And Walking.   "

Which kind of shows how advertising beers on football shirts isn’t the best idea, along with betting companies and other things that kids shouldn’t be interested in.But back to the beer and I had found a different one to Becks Blue, it was a full flavoured beer and just tasting something different meant this at the time was the best beer I had ever drunk.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"
