It made me want to go back to Portugal!Maybe it’s the memories and the fact I am watching football whilst drinking this one but this one gets a place in the top 10 at the time of writing.

It went down really well with a nice bitter tinge of aftertaste.I like this one more than the hazy pale but as mentioned earlier the price keeps its rank down compared to some of the others but will be interesting to see the journey forward for Impossibrew as I like the concept of enchanced beers!Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

My son has been trying a sip of most of the beers recently and this was the first one he said was nice and I agree this was the nice fruity full bodied hazy pale ale.However this is an expensive beer with the packs averaging at £2.50 a can and I think the jury is probably still out on whether this is worth it as it claims to have health benefits as not sure I would want to get a full pack to see that so have stuck this just behind the Days Pale 0% at £2 per bottle rather than this one at 0.5%!Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

    "snippet": "On the 12th of November I received an email from Blogger saying my blog was removed as someone had reported it for spam, this was shortly after a posted 4 reviews of non alcoholic beers, 2 of which I scored low. Maybe just a coincidence? I requested a review from Blogger but this was unsuccessful. Blogger is a free blogging tool from google and I am unable to contact them to find out exactly why they had removed by blog. I could have requested a further review but I decided not to but this meant that all my posts etc were lost.So at that stage I was going to call it a day but my son reminded me of the wayback machine which for those who don’t know is a tool that takes copies of websites and stores them in an archive which meant there was a copy of all my posts for 2021 and luckily I kept a spreadsheet with all my non alcoholic beer reviews.Next my son also reminded me that when I was originally setting up my blog he told me I should have used Jekyll, so with a lot of help from him I have built this new website using Jekyll as the blogging tool. It’s taken us about a month to get to this stage, mainly with him teaching me how to use Markdown and refreshing my memory of HTML and CSS. Still not 100% happy with everything but will be good to spend time with my son next year to finish off.Now the main reasons I wanted to blog was to talk about mental health as I have always found it difficult to talk about it but found putting my thoughts out there helped me expand below to see my posts…                                   All Change Please!Oct 20, 2021                                                           Summer Completed!Sep 29, 2021                                                           Here comes the summer and this is it don&#39;t get scared now!Jun  7, 2021                                                           Supermarket Anxiety!May 16, 2021                                                           Letting my anxiety come on holiday!Apr 17, 2021                                                           Digital MinimalismApr  2, 2021                                                           What comes first to companies wellbeing or profits?

But let’s say clear of polictics and back to my quick fire review of the year…. My Google maps timeline and instagram archive helps me with this each year..Here is my very limited timeline from google mapsJanuaryThe 1st day of 2021 I ran 5km and had a Mcdonalds but then a water leak which left us without water for a few days which wasn’t fun but did remind me of how lucky we are to have running water. Now there wasn’t really much else to report as we were in lockdown but I did have a nice icey walk along the ridgeway and walking alone is one of my favourite things to do to clear my head.FebruaryI made it to the dentist for the first time in many years due to a phobia and got my teeth sorted which was a massive achivement for me even if I did have to have 5 teeth out. I also started a 30 day break from social media in the middle of month (which makes remembering what else I have done more difficult especially as google maps had nothing)MarchNot much happened in March but I decided to give up chocolate for three charities and left it up to how long based on the amount of money I raised which was £200 by the end of April.AprilFor the first 3 months we didn’t venture very far but April we managed to have a little family holiday to cornwall, a trip to London for my son’s birthday to ride the thameslink (it was strange being in London when it was so quiet), a day trip to weymouth to see my mother-in-law and a few more day outs as we had the shackles of lock down were taken off.MayThe highlight of May was a visit to Mollie’s Diner on the A420, a very nice burger. A few days out in the cotswolds filled some time but other than that May was a quiet one as I started to give up chocolate from the 1st. Boris also annouced we could start hugging again but I was hoping that he would have banned hugging forever as I enjoyed social distancing.I also got my first covid jabJuneAfter 8 months of waiting I finally got my new company car and started my journey into electic with a hybrid BMW, what I didn’t know then was that car would be going back in December and that I would be stuck in more traffic in that car then any other car I have ever had, it was pretty unlucky and the sat nav normally made it worse.A trip to weston super mare was the first “longer” distance trip in the car and also a lunch trip to Burford Garden Centre and other days out in the cotswolds. Also my first date with my wife in what felt like years was a trip to a car book.JulyJuly started with painting the kitchen which had been on the list since we had the kitchen done a couple of years ago, it also meant that the kitchen was finished and we promised the kids we would get cats once it was. Euro 2020 was a big highlight which brought back memories of following England home and away in my youth and my 2nd covid jab happened shortly after the final which was also an anti-climax.My son also had his last day at primary school which unfortunately was done remotely and was shortly followed by him testing positive for covid which meant we had to cancel our trip to scotland but at least we had the olympics to keep is going in isolaton!AugustSo instead of going to scotland once we were free from isolation we escaped for a few day trips out to the beach, corfe castle, stratford-upon-avon, we the curious in Bristol and then a very very rare couple of nights away with just my wife in Cornwall!Finally a night away as a family in London and a visit to the HMS Belfast and a hotel with a view of Tower Bridge.The big highlight of August was the new arrivals to the house with our new kittens Ivy and Boe.A new football season kick off with a win for Spurs over Man City the curse of the BMW meant I was a little late and took forever to get home but at least we won.I also returned to the office for the first time since the pandemic so August was a very busy month.SeptemberThe first weekend in September was amazing with a trip to see Hamilton in the west end followed by seeing Rag’n’Bone Man.Other highlights were trying Cadbury Mint Buttons and a mint aero chunky kit kat.My wife and I had a date at the Hand &amp;amp; Flower in Marlow which was amazing as it was also the day I was offered my new job which I celebrated with an expensive steak.And from michelin star to IKEA for meatballs which was our next date!OctoberOctober we celebrated my daugther’s birthday with a party which felt strange after not having one for so long, we also managed to go swimming at Coral Reef in Bracknell where I rode some slides which was out of my comfort zone.My wife and kids also went to Ibiza and I didn’t go for various reasons but it was nice to have some alone time after being together for the whole pandemic. The curse of the BMW returned for the airport pick up I was looking forward to returning the car!NovemberNovember started with the 2nd car failing it’s MOT which meant we then needed to find two new cars before I started my new Job in mid December. One was delviered at the end of November using Cazoo’s subscription service.My wife had a week away in Cornwall and I got one night at the weekend there which was nice and then surived the week without her with the kids and cats.DecemberDecember was all change the old car went back with one final curse the day before as I never made it to football after taking 3 hours to get 50 minutes along the M4.My last day at Zurich after 14 years and then starting my new job.Other highlights included a nice breakfast at mollie’s with just my son as he broke up a day earlier from school than my daugther, a nice day out on the south coast, a trip to see the Book of Morman in the west end including my first trip on the tube sicne the pandemic and a nice meal at Ave Mario, acutally making to tottenham in very good time in the new car without the curse of the BMW, my eldest daughter’s 22nd birthday, Christmas and a trip to Newbury races2022So no new goals or resolutions for 2022 but a new job to get my teeth into lets hope 2022 is kind to you all!"

The first taste was clean and crisp. And a hint of malt citrus aftertaste.After looking up Sessionable on google. {Adjective INFORMAL (of beer) relatively low in alcohol content and therefore suitable for drinking over an extended period}. After the first bottle I think this one could be good for a few in a session unlike some of the beers in the list that leave me bloated after just one or two.I have the Days Pale Ale to try next but this one makes it into the top 10 on my list at the time of writing.

    "snippet": "Last week it was announced by my manager that I would be leaving Zurich after 14 years of working here. This was only the second time in my life I have handed my resignation in to a manager if you don’t include leaving my Saturday job at Sainsburys which I can’t remember how I did that with it being such a long time ago!Now I have changed a lot over the past 14 and not only my physical appearance as seen from my two staff ID badges, the second one was made around the time of my post on LinkedIn in 2019 (which you can see below on my blog post) where I started a journey towards become a new me, I am still on that journey and if the last 3 and a bit years and the current pandemic have taught me anything it’s that life is too short not to take new opportunities if they come along even if you are going into the unknown (now I have the song from Frozen 2 in my head ah ah, oh oh!).                  A new year actually does mean a new me (hopefully)!              2018 was a difficult year for me (and those close to me), I didn&#39;t want to dwell on that too much but if it has taught me one thing it is I will never suffer in silence anymore and thought if anyone out there is reading this and suffering with a mental illness I hope they can learn from my experiences.            So 14 years is a long time and interestingly a couple of months after I started at Zurich the iPhone was released in the UK and for those of you who know me I have never owned one and that&#39;s something that will never change and too be honest the iPhone hasn&#39;t changed much over the years either has it? Unlike me!I will miss working at Zurich but one thing I haven&#39;t come to terms with is having to hand back my company car which was my first step into the world of electric after having to wait so long to receive it due to Covid and Brexit delays...But in all seriousness how do you sum up 14 years of your career: well being an accountant there is only one way to do that and it&#39;s a spreadsheet..."

    "snippet": "Last week we entered the autumn equinox and astronomically the end of the summer and for me this one has been a summer of exposure (along with the spring before it) to things that make me anxious. Living with anxiety is tough and avoidance makes it worse so having lockdowns and restrictions was just what my anxiety wanted.Since my dark days of 2018 I have learnt so much about myself and my anxiety, its part of me and if I want to do stuff I have to accept it will come along for the ride.

Letting my anxiety come on holiday!                                                                                                                Supermarket Anxiety                                               There has been a few bumps in the road but in general it has been an enjoyable summer (is that because meteorologically speaking it hasn’t been a hot one). I have a watch tan mark for the first time I can remember and I have done so many things I wouldn’t have dreamed of back in 2018.But I have also not done things that I am not ready for as I have been using gradual exposure so for example I haven’t been ready to go back on the tube for a couple of visits to London as “Little Andy” wasn’t quite ready for that and something I would like to do on my own first rather than with the Wife and Kids, as strangely for me I struggle more thinking about my anxiety ruining everyone else’s day and when they are with me as I don’t want to show my anxiety and that means fighting to hide it rather than sitting with it something I am working on!Here are some of the highlights of my summer that I am proud to look back on to see how far I have come on my journey…  Hamilton was a true highlight and probably my most anxious ones (due to past anxiety attacks at the theatre). I had been looking forward to this one for ages and my wife was looking forward to it 100 times more than me but the whole performance was amazing and it was great to share this with my wife and see her enjoying herself!  Now this one is an unexpected highlight but I have enjoyed going to a number of Car Boot sales and Charity Shops, I have been avoided buying new clothes to be more sustainable and never thought I would enjoy these so much, even if there is about 10000 times more stuff for my wife to look through and shopping is one of my least favourite things but I love a bargain!  Next up was our trip to London where we stayed in a hotel right by Tower Bridge, had a great visit to HMS Belfast and the Science Museum. The only downside was not being able to go the original plan of the Doctor Who thing as the venue flooded!  A little 2 night trip to Cornwall for just the Wife and I which was lovely apart from the rain, and more importantly I could have a Cornish Pasty as I hadn’t had one since April! We did miss out on a family trip to Scotland just before this as my Son had Covid so was nice to get away from work for a couple of days!!  As I mentioned above we missed out on a trip to Scotland but once my son was free of Covid isolation we managed a few day trips including a nice day on the beach in the sun (which is normally my worst nightmare) and a day in Stratford-upon-Avon which for being so close I have no idea why we hadn’t been before!Looking forward to my favourite season Autumn and hopefully some more exposure to share…"

Lost AF being a larger so I tried this one first as didn’t fancy the Hazy ale. So this one is based on Brewdog’s Lazy Lager which was this planet first German-style Pilsner is a 4.5% lager brewed using wind power, a third less water, and would-be waste bread in the malt bill.Now this was a lighter lager which I prefer with some citrus taste and mild malty bitterness that meant it went down really nicely. All this combining in my favourite offering from Brewdog so far with Nanny State coming in at 4/10, Punk AF coming in at 6/10If you know the mathmatician in me loves a good pattern so I was close to giving this one 8/10 but it deserved an extra 1 out of 10 as I will definately be getting Lost AF again as it ticked nearly all of my AF beer boxes!

But the sun was out, I was sat in the garden after work and as this one was nice and chilled i went in for the first sip and my initial concerns melted away!The real Doom Bar is a treacherous sandbank in Rock, Cornwall. Approach with respect and navigate with skill if you want to stay afloat. That’s what multi-award winning brewery Sharp’s have done to transform the UK’s top selling bottled ale into this immensely satisfying 0% brew.Now not being an ale man the aroma did put me off a little but the taste was balanced with fruity and almost liquorice like flavour.

I couldn’t tell you if there was corinander in there, the taste was pleasant with a slight bitterness on the end.Interestingly only 8 of the 60 beers have had sugar added and 4 of those including this one are from Belgium and I think this beer would go down well with a nice belgium waffle and ice cream, a refreshing drink but is it a beer?

    "snippet": "After 8 months of waiting my new company car finally arrived last week and as the picture above from the my BMW app says its “All Good”.I have always enjoyed having company cars even though it is a bit more expensive I don’t have to worry about anything its all covered and the past 4.5 years I have been driving a non company car and spent a lot of time and money at garages, so back in early November I convinced the wife to go for a new car.I also wanted to start the journey to electric cars but wasn’t ready to go full electric so thought a plug-in hybrid would be a good place to start and also meant the company car tax would be a lot cheaper than the full petrol equivalents.Now I am no expert on cars so the BMW X1 looked like a good choice based on the size we needed, so we had a test drive and then made the order and the delivery date kept slipping further and further away and at one point I nearly cancelled when it went to September 2021, but I didn’t and got a home charging point using the government scheme.The handover from the delivery was pretty much best for you to have a play and take it from there and just trying to turn it round was hard enough as I have only driven an automatic a couple of times I couldn’t get it to start and ended up stuck off my drive.After the initial teething problems we took it for a spin to the coast and then to the zoo the next day and I’m still trying to get used to the onboard computer and all the settings but one I have worked out is changing the colour of the interior lighting strips which my daughter wanted as purple.So having a Plug in car I have started to get lost in the whole EV charging market which is a bit og a minefield but as my home charging unit is from Pod-Point, I found out that most of their public charging points are free and using the app I found out that they supply the charging at most Tesco’s and also at one of my local retail parks. However the Waitrose I use for supporting uses BP Pulse, now luckily signing up to BMW charging app for free has given me 12 months free membership to BP pulse (normally £8.75 per month) and hopefully that will mean free charging when I go shopping there!Finally I needed to see if there was an energy tariff that would be best to use for EV charging, so I contacted my current supplier EDF energy and they couldn’t offer me any special offers on top of their existing EV tariffs which would have meant a large increase in my standard charge and also a large increase in my gas tariff so after googling I found a couple of websites which helped meZap Map (which also has an app with all EV points on updated by the community)&amp;nbsp;Smart Home Charge&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(which allowed you to select your car and provide costing for EV tariffs)So that lead me to Octopus Energy which has a tariff Octopus Go which not only has a 4 hour overnight rate of 5p/kwh also had a low standard rate of 14p/kwh and a low standing charge of 25p per day, which is actually lower that my current tariff and the Gas was pretty comparable. So I have started the switch.If you want to switch to Octopus Energy then follow this link to get a £50 bill credit for yourself and for me as well.&amp;nbsp;Moving on from charging and being someone who loves a good app the my BMW app is also a nice addition to my driving experience, it tells you the status of the car (fuel, charge, where it is parked, if it is locked and if any windows are open), it also allows you to lock and unlock you car, send destinations to the sat nav in the car.There was also a link for BMW company car drivers which gave me a bespoke BBQ box from Pipers Farm worth £35, a Costa Coffee voucher and a prize draw. I am looking forward to see what else comes from BMW Inside Edge.So after a week of having the car we have done 590 miles (which was during half term so did have a couple of days out). To get an idea of how much petrol I use I have recently filled the car up with petrol and reset the journey mileage counter in that time I have done 50 miles and the petrol gauge is still on full so have used pretty much all battery to drive.With the new car I am trying to drive more economical the car has 3 setting for driving and it defaults to Auto which means it will default to electricity until you reach around 60mph or use stronger acceleration. (the other settings are max electric or max petrol).This means that our normal school run or commute can be done all on electric which is around a 30 miles range, it then takes 3 hours to charge from empty with the plan to do this overnight in the lower energy tariff and to use free public charge points to top up charge, so hoping this will cut down the costs of driving!Once I have more data I will share how this goes but for now I am going to try and work out how to change radio stations."

    "snippet": "So we get close to the official start of summer* and for most people they look forward to the weather turning hotter.  *Usually, when we talk about the first day of summer, we are referring to the astronomical summer which is defined by the Earth’s axis and orbit around the Sun, which this year is Monday 21st June.Now I wish i could be like Olaf and be totally oblivious to what Summer actually is in his song in Frozen…Unfortunately I am more like the wicked witch of the west during summer…..I don’t know where and when my issue with Summer started but my anxiety is always heightened.My daily routine in the last few summers looked like this:  Check the weather and UV index  Avoid the sun and stay in (which was great for my anxiety as during last summer as I was working from home)If I am going out the routine changed to:  Check the weather and UV index  Pack enough water to drown in  Check the weather and UV index  Pack the sun cream  Check the weather and UV index  Pack a spare bottle of water in the car  Check the weather and UV index and leave the house  Go back to the house and get my cap  Drink in the car  Try to park the car under a tree or shade  As soon as we get out the car say “do you think we should put sun cream on?”  Put sun cream on myself and the kids anyway whatever the answer  Then my over active bladder kicks in from the water so need to find a toilet  Always try to stay in the shade if possible, but huff and puff if I am not in the shade  Then getting hot and bothered and not being able to tell if I’m really hot or I am having a panic attack  About 20 mins after putting sun cream on my eyes start to water  Drink some more water  huff and puff a bit more  Then getting hot and bothered and not being able to tell if I’m really hot or I am having a panic attack  need to find a toilet again  Check the weather and UV index  Ask my wife if I look red or sunburnt  rub my eyes as they are still watering  Repeat the following 7 steps until its time to get back to the car or find somewhere with aircon                  Drink some more water        huff and puff a bit more        Then getting hot and bothered and not being able to tell if I’m really hot or I am having a panic attack        need to find a toilet again        Check the weather and UV index        Ask my wife if I look red or sunburnt        rub my eyes as they are still watering            When I finally get home feel like I’m ready to melt and then check the weather and UV index for tomorrow and feel relived if it was going to be a rainy day!So this summer I am trying to not be as scared of the sun/heat and when it has been nice in April/May I have gradually been exposing myself to the sun more and not headed straight for the shade.So far so good but it could be a long hot summer so I am going to take it one step at a time, wish me luck!"

It had very little head when I poured and some light bubbles if I was doing a blind taste I would have said instantly this was a German beer.A nice tasting beer which was more refreshing than I thought it would be after the bitterness of the first few sips as it went down very easily even though it left a strong after taste it was not an overly unpleasant one.The strong taste probably comes from the original brewing of this beer being 14.5% ABV  before the alcohol is removed.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

Overall a nice beer and went nicely with a pistachio little moon. The downside is that as the alcoholic versions of Leffe are on the strong side they only have 25cl bottles.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

We’ve woken up from the hangover with a clear head and big ambitions. To specialise where others don’t, To innovate where others aren’t. To finally reward those who aren’t drinking with the beer they deserve.”So was it the beer I deserved as a non-alocholic beer drinker? The first sip the answer was a definate yes it was just what you want for a beer if I hadn’t read the label showing the  0.5% I would have thought I was drinking a full alcohol pilsner, with a nice malt taste mixed with citrus, then a nice bitterness at the end.It was all going well but it dropped from a 9/10 to 8/10 as the later sips it seemed to lose the taste slightly so didn’t have the longevity, but I am looking forward to finding one of the 100 pubs that have this beer on draught as there is nothing like aFollow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

    "snippet": "So yesterday I told my wife something I hadn’t told anyone before because I thought it was stupid but supermarkets are a trigger for my anxiety.I told her that once when we were in a French supermarket I was so anxious I had to go back to the car, at the time I didn’t say that was why I was going back to the car and she said she couldn’t even remember that occasion.If I ever go to a supermarket (or any shop let’s be honest) I’m a like to have my list get in and get out kind of shopper! The funny thing is I used to work in a supermarket for a few years but now I can feel sort of claustrophobic, I don’t feel great in all the bright unnatural lights and finally my least favourite thing other people!Now one benefit for me of this whole Pandemic is that I’ve been able to work on my anxiety in supermarkets supported by them not having as many people in them and also I’ve been lucky that my wife works for John Lewis so we get discount in Waitrose, and my local one has a lot of natural light.So rather than avoiding, I have been gradually exposing my self to my anxiety and even visited other supermarkets during lockdown to help myself.I am not saying I am at the stage where I could happily browse in all the isles for hours but I can at least stop and look at the nutritional details on the odd item.Progress is progress after all!"

    "snippet": "Yesterday I got home from a 4 night break in Cornwall, but this time last week I was in bed thinking I’m never going to be able to go on holiday again!I actually stayed in bed until Sunday evening and then when Monday came even though I was anxious about my first holiday in nearly 2 years I wasn’t exhausted from fighting the anxiety and I had given my body what it needed a rest, now I’m lucky that I could spend two days in bed.So if I look at my historic holidays and days out, I would spend the whole time fighting the anxiety and be exhausted, I would never enjoy myself or would end up spending days in bed whilst on holiday or I would stay in bed and end up not going or in some cases my IBS flaring would mean i would be too anxious to go on things like friend’s stag do and would cancel last minute!So actually making it on Holiday felt like a massive achievement especially when I look back on everything I had missed in the past and the view from our accommodation was worth it.        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Andy Boorman (@anxiousaccountant)So in my therapy sessions we spoke about allowing my anxiety to come on holiday with me rather than leaving it behind, so now I call my anxiety “Little Andy” and this was the first holiday that I let him come rather than trying to leave him at home.By doing this I actually enjoyed most of the holiday by not putting pressure on my self and not fighting my anxiety however there were some times when I defaulted to putting the barrier up!The other things that also helped with the anxiety were  The fact Cornwall is my favourite place to go. (but only managed to get a Cornish Pasty on the last day which was very unlike me and was nearly a no go as I got the last one from Philps in Hayle!)  The fact it was only 4 nights. (Starting in smaller breaks will allow me to gradually expose myself to the anxiety)  The fact that it wasn’t going aboard. (Again starting with a familiar place helps with the gradual exposure)  Finally, telling my wife about my anxiety and not keeping it to myself so the pressure was taken off trying to cover it up. (something I am still working on though)I think for the first time in a very very long time I actually felt relaxed on holiday, enjoyed some really amazing food, some amazing sunsets,  and for some of the time lived in the moment which was good for my wife and kids to see.Little Andy will be coming on holiday from now on and by not avoiding this holiday I think I can use the good feelings as motivation to go on longer and further trips knowing its ok to be nervous about holidays. (I might also make sure I book in a couple of extra days before holiday to mentally prepare myself)But if anyone else has any other tips for holiday anxiety please share…"

View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Andy Boorman (@anxiousaccountant)This book takes you through a lot of the pitfalls you end up in with Social Media and has some really good practical guides to cutting your screen time.A full digital detox is not as sustainable and the book shows you how to use technology with more intention and purpose.I would suggest getting this book in printed or e-book as it would be easier to refer back to than the audiobook version I had, but that being said it has helped me cut my screen time especially on social media massively.I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to take control of their scrolling and the only downside is the Americanism (which I think are worse in Audio) but once you get used to them its all good."

    "snippet": "I ran this poll on LinkedIn with no context click here for the final results.In my opinion I think it will always be profits for the companies unless we all push the agenda for wellbeing, for example you don’t see the number of people who have been off work for a stress related reasons in the press release on a companies results announcement day.Now I know that investors want to see big returns as we live in a society where money rules the world and true wellbeing is expensive business, however the costs of not having the wellbeing of employees at the top of their priorities could be much higher.I am not saying that companies aren’t doing anything and the wellbeing movement has come a long way but 17.9 million days were lost to stress, depression or anxiety in 2019/2020 tax year according to https://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/dayslost.htm and on average, each person suffering took 21.6 days off.This isn’t an issue that can be solved by those at the top, its up to everyone! I know from experience that work is only one reason that causes stress, depression and anxiety. It took me to get to a real dark place to realise that I am more important than my job and I am still on the journey of getting my work life balance right for me.This has been one of the areas I have focussed on with my therapist, I have basically thrown out my old rule book for the past 40 years that were very black &amp;amp; white and feeding my high functional anxiety. This means that what you see is not telling the whole story of me…My therapy sessions have now ended and one of the outcomes was my new rules for living and try to notice when I am not following them but its difficult to rip up the book on 40 years of behaviours but by writing down and reviewing my rules down on a regular basis will hopefully help.So with that in mind here are my new rules of living without all the context of 40 years and my recent 10 psychotherapy sessions which I might go into another time:  I am number one! (this doesn’t mean I am selfish)  It’s not all black and white embrace the grey!  It’s ok to say “No”  It’s ok to not got out.  Don’t let things fester.  It’s ok to raise my true thoughts.  It’s ok to say how I’m feeling.  It’s ok to complain.  I can work at home unless I need to be in the office.  It’s ok to have my own space.  It’s ok to do a good enough job.  It’s ok to be “fun Andy” and it’s ok not to be!  Remember the positives."

Limited Fermentation: alcohol in beer is produced during fermentation, when yeast breaks down the sugar, this can be done in a variety of different waysLimiting Fermentable Sugars: Using grains that produce less fermentable sugars or techniques that limit the sugars from the grains in the mashing process.Special Yeast Strains: Some yeast strains will naturally produce less alcohol on fermentation but this may leave you more sugars in the final beer or other leave the beer with a sour taste.Blocking Fermentation: By changing the environment (eg temperature, acidity) during fermentation can either stop or slow down the process leaving less alcohol but you may be left with a sweeter or “unfinished” tasting beer.        Watering Down: So rather than removing the alcohol you dilute the finished beer with water, with this process you need to make a concentrate beer first.        Avoid Fermentation: By not fermenting the beer you avoid creating the alcohol but you also avoid doing what makes a beer a beer but producers tweak the production process to create a drink that looks and tastes like a beer.  Below is a link to more details on each of the beers I have tried. (I can’t confirm for definite that I have tried a beer from each of the 4 techniques above but I know for definite I have tried a reverse osmosis and avoid fermentation) My Top Ranked Beers                   Peroni Libera 0.0%              So after my first try of non alcoholic beer in 2007 it took 12 years for me to find a beer worthy of a full 10/10. I spotted it on a random trip to Tesco and even though it was more expensive than any of the previous 30+ beers, I had to give it a try.                                         1                    My Rating: 10/10                                    San Miguel 0,0              So a family trip to Ibiza in 2014 and one of the best non-alcoholic beers. I am not sure if the sun was a factor or that it tasted just like the real San Miguel but it was almost like the best beer I had tasted for such a long time, but my early relationship with San Miguel 0,0 was cut short after a week in Ibiza.                                         2                    My Rating: 9.5/10                                    Heineken Zero (Draught)              It was Christmas Eve as I walked into the pub I noticed Heineken Zero was available on draught what a early Christmas present my first ever pint of non-alcoholic beer!!!                                        3                    My Rating: 9.5/10                                    Heineken Zero              Another road trip this time to the south of France and a stop over in central France for the night delivered another new beer and one that now is a staple in my non-alcoholic beer journey as its available widely in the UK and is the non-alcoholic beer in the new Tottenham hotspur stadium.                                         4                    My Rating: 9/10                                    Birra Moretti Zero              With the Drive behind me it was onto our first meal in Italy on the holiday and my first Italian non-alcoholic beer.

We booked an outside table at The Trout at Tadpole Bridge and the meal was really good but topped off by the FreeStar beer.Interestingly FreeStar is made by an alcohol free process and that comes across in the taste which was nice and refreshing, with light citrus tastes giving way to the perle hops coming through as a savoury twist.Another great thing about this beer is it the process for making emits 90% less CO2 than the industry average also with 80% less water and 70% less waste compared to the processes used in regular beer.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

    "snippet": "Today is the deadline for us to complete our Self-Reflection on our performance management system at work and as I was self-reflecting on my performance at work for the year it made me realise that I have had a real journey the past 365 days personally as tomorrow marks the day from a year ago when I intended to take my own life.So 16th November 2018 was a turning point in my life and in my previous articles A new year actually does mean a new me and It&#39;s OK to not be OK! I have spoken about the my mental health openly which I would never have done before but even now I still find myself defaulting to being a closed book even with those closest to me when I am not OK but that&#39;s OK because I eventually remind myself to tell and this is something I am going to work on during the next part of my journey.However this article is more about the things I have done in the last 365 days as going back to the turning point I would never have imagined could have done anything and if anyone else out there feels suicidal it has shown me that it does get better.November 2018 and December 2018 are pretty much a blur but here is a list of things in 2019 that on self-reflection I&#39;m please I stayed around for I have probably forgotten some key ones but my memory isn&#39;t what it was:I started my phased returned to work in January 2019.5th January: Managed to make it to London to watch The Cursed Child for my Wife&#39;s birthday.13th January: I shared my first article on my mental health A new year actually does mean a new me.15th February: Had a weekend break in Torquay.2nd March : Took my son to his first North London derby.3rd April: I used my spurs season ticket for the first time for the very first game at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.22nd April: Went to Chessington for my Son&#39;s birthday!26th April: I went to see an ENT specialist after putting up with sinus problems for years (despite nearly fainting at the hospital), I got steroids from him which have really helped my sinuses!24th May: I went on holiday to St Ives in Cornwall with my Wife and my 2 youngest children. I felt bad on a couple of the days but enjoyed the time away.4th June: Went with my wife to see Hugh Jackman at the O2.14th June: Went to see Gazza and Vinnie Jones at the Oasis.26th June: I shared another article on my mental health It&#39;s OK to not be OK!23rd July: I was part of a presentation to our Group CFO on the UK IFRS 17 project.6th August: Had a short break to the Lake District.6th September: Met Ledley King at a Swindon Spurs legends night.9th September: I change my working hours by compressing my full time hours into 4 days.10th September: Booked a holiday to Florida for November 2020, just need to work on getting there unlike New York in 2018.11th September: I made a post about suicide prevention which got a lot of comments and messages, which has led to making a new friend from around the world.22nd September: Went on a mini-cruise but didn&#39;t see any of Belgium as I was in bed with a migraine.26th September: Met Gary Mabutt at a Swindon Town legends night.1st October: Delivered a training session on IFRS 17 to some senior finance execs.23rd October: Went to London so my Son could go on the last remaining tube lines he needed to go on!25th October: Went on a last minute break to Cornwall, wasn&#39;t feeling that great but spoke to my wife and she helped me deal with it!13th November: Went to the cinema with my wife without the kids!14th November: Helped deliver a training session on IFRS 17 to a number of finance team members.Now no list from an accountant can be complete without some numbers so here are a few about the last 365 days: 10 visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium gradually seeing worse performances each time luckily missing some of the worst performances through illness, an average of 2.5 visits to see a Doctor per month so much so the receptionists all know me well, getting to do the school run about 15% of the time, using our family national trust memberships to save over £300 on visits and parking and finally 4,048 deleted work emails since I have gone onto outlook!So what&#39;s next? I need to work on my anxiety around holidays and days out but looking back at this list is helpful in realising I can do all these things despite not being fully recovered from my mental health problems!And remember if you don&#39;t feel OK please tell someone!Thanks Andy"

    "snippet": "Yesterday all my troubles seemed so far away after a weekend spent in bed with sickness and an upset stomach, which looks like it must have been something I ate as luckily nobody else in the family has come down with anything, so I took Monday off as I hadn’t really eaten anything.So feeling slightly more human yesterday morning I thought it would be a good idea to go back to work but not only was I still physically fragile let’s just say a little more mentally fragile than I could deal with, so for the first time in ages I cried at work (in the toilets) and then on the bus on the way home (when my wife messaged asking if I was OK after I said I was going home) and then again when I finally got home after the hottest bus ride ever (maybe more in relief that anything)So I keep myself busy working from home until lunch time and I have that hungry/nauseous feeling that you don’t know whether you are coming or going after you haven’t been feeling well, then eat some lunch, my stomach making some strange noises reminding me that my IBS hasn’t been out to play for a while, a quick walk and then home in time for another cry.Back to work and getting deep into the fun that is accounting for the Variable Fee Approach under IFRS 17 with profits contracts and keeping in touch with colleagues through Skype messages and that was the afternoon done until the kids get back from their dentist appointment which fortunately it wasn’t at two thirty!So on the work front a productive day and being in the lucky position that I can work from home helps, the distraction of work keeps the black dog at bay most of the time but it proves I still have a long way to go in my journey and I need to keep asking for help and I still find it hard to speak to people about my feelings, so writing them down is going to be a way of letting myself know it’s OKAY not to be OK and reminds me not to push myself too hard especially when I am not feeling physically well.Working at home again today just put this up in my lunch break as I’m about to take a little walk around the village still feeling nauseous but on the plus side no tears as yet!"

I spotted it on a random trip to Tesco and even though it was more expensive than any of the previous 30+ beers, I had to give it a try.Now I always liked a bottle of Peroni when in an Italian restaurant and the non-alcoholic lived up to the “good” old days.There is no downside to this beer for me as it isn’t overly carbonated, it has a nice light fruity taste and only a small about of bitterness coming through at the end. A really refreshing and easy to drink beer which is worth the premium price.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"

    "snippet": "2018 was a difficult year for me (and those close to me), I didn&#39;t want to dwell on that too much but if it has taught me one thing it is I will never suffer in silence anymore and thought if anyone out there is reading this and suffering with a mental illness I hope they can learn from my experiences.I have found that &quot;I&#39;m fine&quot;, &quot;I&#39;m OK&quot;, &quot;Yes I can do that&quot;, &quot;No worries&quot; and things similar to that were something I said a lot last year (and throughout my life) and I would continue to put on the brave face even to those closest to me.Looking back when I was off with Anxiety and Depression in the summer for just over 3 weeks I returned to work not changing anything, not getting all the support I needed or knew I could get and putting that brave face on and it meant nothing had changed. But I was being told I was doing all the right things by my Doctor but can&#39;t help but think I wasn&#39;t telling them the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.So fast forward to October and living the lie finally caught up with me, I had hit rock bottom and didn&#39;t know where to turn and I thought I shouldn&#39;t be feeling like this I have a great wife, 3 lovely kids, a 5 bed detached house with a enjoyable career that I have worked hard to achieve . It was finally time to cry for help now I won&#39;t go into details but I didn&#39;t do it in the right way but it was the turning point that led me to get the help and supported I really needed, didn&#39;t know I could get or if I am being honest didn&#39;t want to look for as I thought I shouldn&#39;t need that help.So now those closest to me knew how bad I was, my wife sprang into action and her support was invaluable to get family around me (who I have been too proud to ask for help from) so I wasn&#39;t alone whilst she had to kept the day to day family life going and so not to impact on the kids.I always felt like I needed to be back at work as soon as I felt a little better as I hate having time off work sick, but this time was different with the support of my manager that pressure was taken away and gave me time to accept I have a mental illness and things had to change. I also found out that I was eligible through my work&#39;s private medical insurance I could receive 10 sessions with a private counselor and we had occupational health teams that we can work with to support your return to work.Now I am very lucky I work for a big company and I don&#39;t want to go political here but there just isn&#39;t enough money provided by the government to support mental health issues in the UK, my doctor&#39;s surgery (apart from one receptionist) has been fantastic for me but everything just takes so much time. Swindon is lucky to have the LIFT service (Lift Website) which provides great courses to help you manage things but I found when I was feeling bad and going to these courses I couldn&#39;t take anything in. Then the wait to see a LIFT practitioner one on one can be months and then you can only see them for a limited time and not regular enough as there are too many people suffering out there.So I felt I was ready to come back to work just before the Christmas break and it turned out that was perfect as I had a couple of days back in the office and managed to clear most of my 1500 emails I had received and meant when I came back in this year I was ready thanks to my manager and colleagues able to then have 100% focus on the IFRS 17 project which I never really had time to do in 2018 as other projects and business took my focus away and from speaking to my counselor maybe added to the my stress issues even though I had always said I made out that work wasn&#39;t an issue to everyone I spoke to and I couldn&#39;t say No as for some reason I have always wanted to please!As I am writing this I have managed 20 hours work last week as part of my phased return and there has been good days and not so good days but I am being open and honest to everyone who is willing to listen. So as I said at the start if all of the above has taught me one thing it is I will never suffer in silence anymore and if anyone out there is reading this and suffering with a mental illness please find someone to talk too!And finally here are a few other things that have help me other than the people around me:    Breathing (This is something that is always there and you can focus on your breathing as a way to distract from thoughts, but also I have been doing the 4-7-8 breathing technique developed by Dr Weil which is a simple portable stress antidote.)    Mediation (I have been using the Headspace app and this also has tools to help with sleep look here for more details www.headspace.com)    Reflexology (Not only for my Anxiety and Depression but for my sinuses, Reflexology is a relaxing foot (or hand) massage that works on the pressure points in the feet to stimulate and relax the internal organs, more information from my can be found here: http://reflexologyinoldtown.co.uk/)    Hypnotherapy (Now I was skeptical before this but it isn&#39;t like every time my wife clicks her fingers I now cluck like a chicken, the aim to a solution focused hypnotherapy which looks to make you feel more positive about life - more information from my hypnotherapist can be found here: https://joharrishypnotherapy.com/)    Mindfulness: A practical guide to finding peace in a frantic world (This is a book which is based on Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy by Mark Williams and Danny Penman which my counselor recommended to me.)    Matt Haig (The books Reasons to Stay Alive and Notes on a Nervous Planet are a honest look at anxiety and depression, I also follow him on Twitter now.)    Not logging into Facebook.    Not looking at my phone in the bedroom.    Getting out of bed even when I don&#39;t feel like it!    Getting out the house even when I don&#39;t feel like it even if its just to go for a walk!    Walking.    And Walking.   "

This beer was really needed as we drove to Lake Garda stopping over at a eurocamps in France on the way down where we got two punctured tyres on a French Bank Holiday and I left my wife and kids to go with the car with a breakdown man who spoke no English to get new tyres which somehow we managed to communicate and we got on our way the next morning through Switzerland to Italy.Anyway onto the beer which was ironic that it was called drive after we had just driven about 1000 miles over 2 days to get there.

Which kind of shows how advertising beers on football shirts isn’t the best idea, along with betting companies and other things that kids shouldn’t be interested in.But back to the beer and I had found a different one to Becks Blue, it was a full flavoured beer and just tasting something different meant this at the time was the best beer I had ever drunk.Follow my Non-Alcoholic Beer Journey"
