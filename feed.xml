Score: 37 (out of 100) / Rank: 138th (out of 164 beers) / A fresh nice fruity smelling beer and an initial lively beer but it lost its fizz after a couple of minutes.

The smell didn’t transfer to the taste so was a little disappointing just like the first half of England’s quarter final at the world cup

Score: 51 (out of 100) / Rank: 90th (out of 164 beers) / My first new beer in what feels like ages and this one was a warm up before England’s world cup quart final.

This one had a nice colour and smell. It was nice and refreshing with a slight bitter zest!

It went down nicely but didn’t calm the pre match nerves

Score: 47 (out of 100) / Rank: 105th (out of 164 beers) / Now I can’t remember having a nutty beer in my list but I could smell the nuttiness as I poured this one seemed to have no fizz at all.

And the nuttiness taste came through but it did remind me of an ice coffee and this time it was pleasant unlike some of the other coffee tasting ones

Score: 52 (out of 100) / Rank: 91st (out of 164 beers) / This one was had a really strong smell right after opening and the colour certainly had that saffron feel to it

The taste was very strong and might have been too overpowering but strangely refreshing

Score: 33 (out of 100) / Rank: 145th (out of 164 beers) / The smell of this one reminded me of the coop lemon shady I used to have as a kid. It has the strongest smell from a beer I’ve had for a while

The taste also reminded me of the coop lemon shandy which I loved as a kid but I think my tastes have changed as it was more like a soft drink. Pleasant but not really like a beer
