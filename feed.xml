Score: 71 (out of 100) / Rank: 22nd (out of 116 beers) / Another drink after gardening and another fruit beer, this one poured with a strong raspberry smell.

The raspberry came strongly in the taste with a twist of sour hoppy bitterness which worked

This id my favourite sour / fruit beer so far.

Score: 27 (out of 100) / Rank: 108th (out of 116 beers) / Spotted this one at my local farm shop and didn’t realise until I got home that it was 0.5% ABV. So adding it to the list

It was very much a soft drink and was very sweet, with a very light bitterness in the after taste. Not helped as England conceded to Germany as I drank this

Not really going to trouble the scorers but reminded me o...

Score: 90 (out of 100) / Rank: 2nd (out of 116 beers) / The first mental health beer where the proceeds go towards Talk Club which is a talking and listening movement to help people get mentally fit.

This one poured with a vibrant colour and a small head, the taste was smooth with a nice bitter aftertaste, it went down really well.

Overall a great beer and a great cause!!

Score: 43 (out of 100) / Rank: 80th (out of 116 beers) / This one poured with very little head but I couldn’t pick up anything in the smell.

There wasn’t really much in the taste apart from a slight bitter aftertaste.

Not one that I will be rushing back to.

Score: 66 (out of 100) / Rank: 36th (out of 116 beers) / I had this one after I got home from a walk which had the toughest climb I had done for a while and needed to take my mind off my achy legs. Not quite into a mountain!

My first beer from South Africa and it poured with a lively head and a strong fruity smell. The taste was refreshing with a slight bitterness.

It went down really well a...
