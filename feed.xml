Score: 97 (out of 100) / Rank: 1st (out of 135 beers) / Today I had a PINT and it’s only been my second since I gave up drinking alcohol in 2011! This one was actually on tap the previous was just a Heineken zero out of a blade machine on the top of a bar.

I’ve been meaning to go to the Tap in Marlbourgh since I had seen it on the AF club on tap map as it is not far from my house and today wa...

Score: 87 (out of 100) / Rank: 6th (out of 135 beers) / The old recipe was really nice to was hoping the new one lived up to the old one. A nice smell from the pour which was a good start.

Taste wise it’s been a while since I tried the old recipe but the new one was a clear and crisp taste followed by a bitterness which didn’t disappoint.

Free star is also a sustainable beer so some bonus po...

Score: 33 (out of 100) / Rank: 119th (out of 135 beers) / Nice to pour a beer that doesn’t go to fizzy and this one had a strong smell which reminded me of something but I just can’t put my hat on it.

Even though it poured without a head there was a surprisingly bubbly feel on my tongue which wasn’t unpleasant and the taste was ok but again i couldn’t pin down any particular taste coming thro...

Score: 46 (out of 100) / Rank: 86th (out of 135 beers) / Another fizzy beer which poured with a big head but the smell reminded of lagers of my youth.

It was smooth and a little too bubbly but went down really well in the heatwave but it wasn’t l until I had finished that a bit of an aftertaste came through.

I may have drunk this one two quick to savour the full taste.

Score: 82 (out of 100) / Rank: 13th (out of 135 beers) / A bright colour can to match the bright beer as it poured with a pleasant but non distinct smell.

I was trying this one with my alfresco dinner and the first taste was really nice and there was a nice aftertaste which went well with the cod and chorizo fishcakes.

It might be the heatwave talking but I think this is my favourite IPA to ...
