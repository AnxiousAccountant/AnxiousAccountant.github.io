Score: 65 (out of 100) / Rank: 54th (out of 140 beers) / A day out with some friends ended with us going back to their house for home made pizzas so stopped off at Aldi and picked up a pack of these to try.

A nice beer that went down really well whilst watching the home made pizza cook in the pizza oven.

Score: 60 (out of 100) / Rank: 48th (out of 140 beers) / A great can design and it poured with a nice head and a cloudy appearance.

A clear and almost fluffy taste with a twist of bitterness coming through.

I think this was my first XPA and hoping it won’t be the last

Score: 72 (out of 100) / Rank: 21st (out of 140 beers) / Another sour beer and this one had a lovely smell as I poured.

And the taste was fruity with a nice zingy sour which went down really smoothly. I hate to say it but I’m liking the sour beers recently.

My son tried it and said he liked it and also didn’t like it at the same time.

Score: 44 (out of 100) / Rank: 88th (out of 140 beers) / The darkest beer I have had for a while but I didn’t get anything in the smell.

Taste wise it was a little bitter but no real strong taste coming through, pleasant but nothing to write home about.

Score: 66 (out of 100) / Rank: 45th (out of 140 beers) / A another UK heatwave and what do you want on a far like that we ice cream and for today that comes in the form of a coffee ice cream sour beer.

Didn’t like the colour of this one but the smell was pleasant. I could get coffee, and mango in the taste with a kick of sour in the mix.

I haven’t had much luck with sour beers bu...
