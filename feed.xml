Score: 22 (out of 100) / Rank: 112th (out of 119 beers) / Another Beer trying to cool down and this one was a lively little number.

No real smell but there was a strong sourness up front which didn’t sit well, almost soapy.

After two nice beers before this one left a sour taste and more annoyingly I have no more in the fridge!

Score: 53 (out of 100) / Rank: 66th (out of 119 beers) / Another milkstout and this one has a coffee smell and was dark as expected.

I’ve had Mixed experiences with these stouts but this one was not like a cold coffee, Instead it had a nica matty taste and a strong but pleasant after taste.

It was probably not the best weather for it being so hot but went down well.

Score: 71 (out of 100) / Rank: 22nd (out of 119 beers) / Hottest day of the year so far very and a cold beer was in order, this one was fizzy and my son sometimes has a sip of my beers and he said he doesn’t like beer but this is his favorite so far.

Perfect for a hot day after the working week!

It had a fruity smell and a clear and crisp taste with a nice bitter aftertaste.

Score: 71 (out of 100) / Rank: 23rd (out of 119 beers) / Another drink after gardening and another fruit beer, this one poured with a strong raspberry smell.

The raspberry came strongly in the taste with a twist of sour hoppy bitterness which worked

This is my favourite sour / fruit beer so far.

Score: 27 (out of 100) / Rank: 110th (out of 119 beers) / Spotted this one at my local farm shop and didn’t realise until I got home that it was 0.5% ABV. So adding it to the list

It was very much a soft drink and was very sweet, with a very light bitterness in the after taste. Not helped as England conceded to Germany as I drank this

Not really going to trouble the scorers but reminded me o...
