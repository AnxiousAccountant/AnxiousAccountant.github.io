Score: 67 (out of 100) / Rank: 37th (out of 129 beers) / Another beer needed to cool off in the heat and this time an elderflower beer.

This one was the clearest beer I’ve had for a will and had a sweet smell.

The taste was very sweet taste but had a slight bitterness, if was more like a soft drink but very nice on a hot summers day.

Score: 60 (out of 100) / Rank: 59th (out of 129 beers) / The hottest day of the year so a fruity choice called me when I opened the fridge.

You could smell the pineapple as I poured and the taste was sweet and you could really get the pineapple which in some of the other fruity beers I haven’t got before.

A nice beer to wash down lunch on a hot day, not sure I would have it on a regular basi...

Score: 43 (out of 100) / Rank: 94th (out of 129 beers) / Another can that popped as I opened with a bit of the beer flying over the kitchen side but straight away a strong fruity smell.

It was far too lively to poor and took about 5 minutes to settle but once it had there was a strong bitterness from the start but it wasn’t unpleasant.

It was just let down by being too gassy as it did repeat...

Score: 66 (out of 100) / Rank: 41st (out of 129 beers) / I have seen a lot of people sharing this one on Instagram and glad it came in my AF club for July so I could try.

This one didn’t have a smell but that might be the vaseline on my nose to stop the pollen getting in my nose. But taste wise this is the first beer in a while which took me back to being out drunk in a club at 18.

Not sayin...

Score: 73 (out of 100) / Rank: 20th (out of 129 beers) / Thought it was only right to try my new Brulo glass with a Brulo beer and on first glance I didn’t think the whole can would fit in but it did!

This one had a subtle fizz and a subtle smell, a subtle first taste but a nice strong aftertaste.

This one went down well and had more to it compared to the beer earlier in the evening.
