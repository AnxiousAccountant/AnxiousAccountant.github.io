      It’s been a while since I have shared my thoughts on my mental health and whilst I am recovering from Covid and not being in Ibiza with the family I have had a lot of time to think I thought it was worth getting some of those out of my head. The first one being will tea ever taste right again (it had better do!) and why has my asthma come back which I will speak to the doctor about luckily I ha...

Score: 72 (out of 100) / Rank: 28th (out of 155 beers) / A green beer and my kids were excited seeing this one as they love sour patch kids sweets. My daughter tried to steal it after trying it.

Now this one was very sweet but could still get the beer taste coming through.

Score: 40 (out of 100) / Rank: 110th (out of 155 beers) / I thought I had tried this before but it was their pale ale Innis &amp;amp; nonn.

This one poured with a nice head and left a nice head trail down the glass as I drank it was crisp but lack a bit of flavour.

Score: 55 (out of 100) / Rank: 76th (out of 155 beers) / A brown ale which poured nice and dark with a slight coffee smell and some light bubbles.

I was expecting this to have a strong dark taste but it was actually a smooth light coffee taste. It went down really well.

Score: 45 (out of 100) / Rank: 103rd (out of 155 beers) / Another new Brulo beer to try in my Brulo glass and as always it poured perfectly even it is a bit darker than my normal.

A nice smell with a strong taste but without being over powering. It went down really well after a stressful day.
