Score: 62 (out of 100) / Rank: 50th (out of 123 beers) / This one was very lively and there was a mild fruity smell, I did struggle to get the head to not be half of the glass when I poured.

Once it settled the taste was nice refereshing beer with a smooth aftertaste.

Overall a nice average beer.

Score: 71 (out of 100) / Rank: 26th (out of 123 beers) / Another mental health beer this one with Nice fruity smell a bit fizzy off the bat but settled down.

A crisp taste with a little fruit coming through no real aftertaste to talk about.

This one went down well whilst watching the stranger things finale.

Score: 62 (out of 100) / Rank: 49th (out of 123 beers) / A risky choice to try a new beer whilst my hayfever is bad but I have too many new beers to get through as I haven’t got through last month’s Afbeer club yet!

I couldn’t pick up anyhting in the smell but the taste came across as a tangy and refreshing with a mild aftertaste.

Score: 45 (out of 100) / Rank: 81st (out of 123 beers) / Probably the loudest beer I have had with a very bubbly head which didn’t settle for a long time.

The taste improved as it finally settled and did have a nice bitter aftertaste, so not really looking to trouble the scorers.

Score: 22 (out of 100) / Rank: 117th (out of 123 beers) / Another Beer trying to cool down and this one was a lively little number.

No real smell but there was a strong sourness up front which didn’t sit well, almost soapy.

After two nice beers before this one left a sour taste and more annoyingly I have no more in the fridge!
