<meta name="description" content="Today is the deadline for us to complete our Self-Reflection on our performance management system at work and as I was self-reflecting on my performance at work for the year it made me realise that I have had a real journey the past 365 days personally as tomorrow marks the day from a year ago when I intended to take my own life. So 16th November 2018 was a turning point in my life and in my previous articles A new year actually does mean a new me and It&#39;s OK to not be OK! I have spoken about the my mental health openly which I would never have done before but even now I still find myself defaulting to being a closed book even with those closest to me when I am not OK but that&#39;s OK because I eventually remind myself to tell and this is something I am going to work on during the next part of my journey. However this article is more about the things I have done in the last 365 days as going back to the turning point I would never have imagined could have done anything and if anyone else out there feels suicidal it has shown me that it does get better. November 2018 and December 2018 are pretty much a blur but here is a list of things in 2019 that on self-reflection I&#39;m please I stayed around for I have probably forgotten some key ones but my memory isn&#39;t what it was: I started my phased returned to work in January 2019.5th January: Managed to make it to London to watch The Cursed Child for my Wife&#39;s birthday.13th January: I shared my first article on my mental health A new year actually does mean a new me.15th February: Had a weekend break in Torquay.2nd March : Took my son to his first North London derby.3rd April: I used my spurs season ticket for the first time for the very first game at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.22nd April: Went to Chessington for my Son&#39;s birthday!26th April: I went to see an ENT specialist after putting up with sinus problems for years (despite nearly fainting at the hospital), I got steroids from him which have really helped my sinuses!24th May: I went on holiday to St Ives in Cornwall with my Wife and my 2 youngest children. I felt bad on a couple of the days but enjoyed the time away.4th June: Went with my wife to see Hugh Jackman at the O2.14th June: Went to see Gazza and Vinnie Jones at the Oasis.26th June: I shared another article on my mental health It&#39;s OK to not be OK!23rd July: I was part of a presentation to our Group CFO on the UK IFRS 17 project.6th August: Had a short break to the Lake District.6th September: Met Ledley King at a Swindon Spurs legends night.9th September: I change my working hours by compressing my full time hours into 4 days.10th September: Booked a holiday to Florida for November 2020, just need to work on getting there unlike New York in 2018.11th September: I made a post about suicide prevention which got a lot of comments and messages, which has led to making a new friend from around the world.22nd September: Went on a mini-cruise but didn&#39;t see any of Belgium as I was in bed with a migraine.26th September: Met Gary Mabutt at a Swindon Town legends night.1st October: Delivered a training session on IFRS 17 to some senior finance execs.23rd October: Went to London so my Son could go on the last remaining tube lines he needed to go on!25th October: Went on a last minute break to Cornwall, wasn&#39;t feeling that great but spoke to my wife and she helped me deal with it!13th November: Went to the cinema with my wife without the kids!14th November: Helped deliver a training session on IFRS 17 to a number of finance team members.Now no list from an accountant can be complete without some numbers so here are a few about the last 365 days: 10 visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium gradually seeing worse performances each time luckily missing some of the worst performances through illness, an average of 2.5 visits to see a Doctor per month so much so the receptionists all know me well, getting to do the school run about 15% of the time, using our family national trust memberships to save over £300 on visits and parking and finally 4,048 deleted work emails since I have gone onto outlook! So what&#39;s next? I need to work on my anxiety around holidays and days out but looking back at this list is helpful in realising I can do all these things despite not being fully recovered from my mental health problems! And remember if you don&#39;t feel OK please tell someone! Thanks Andy" />

        <p>Today is the deadline for us to complete our Self-Reflection on our performance management system at work and as I was self-reflecting on my performance at work for the year it made me realise that I have had a real journey the past 365 days personally as tomorrow marks the day from a year ago when I intended to take my own life.</p>
<p>So 16th November 2018 was a turning point in my life and in my previous articles <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-year-actually-does-mean-me-hopefully-andrew-boorman-fcca/" target="_blank">A new year actually does mean a new me</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-okay-ok-andrew-boorman-fcca/" target="_blank">It's OK to not be OK!</a> I have spoken about the my mental health openly which I would never have done before but even now I still find myself defaulting to being a closed book even with those closest to me when I am not OK but that's OK because I eventually remind myself to tell and this is something I am going to work on during the next part of my journey.</p>
<p>However this article is more about the things I have done in the last 365 days as going back to the turning point I would never have imagined could have done anything and if anyone else out there feels suicidal it has shown me that it does get better.</p>
<p>November 2018 and December 2018 are pretty much a blur but here is a list of things in 2019 that on self-reflection I'm please I stayed around for I have probably forgotten some key ones but my memory isn't what it was:</p>
<ol><li>I started my phased returned to work in January 2019.</li><li>5th January: Managed to make it to London to watch The Cursed Child for my Wife's birthday.</li><li>13th January: I shared my first article on my mental health <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-year-actually-does-mean-me-hopefully-andrew-boorman-fcca/" target="_blank">A new year actually does mean a new me</a>.</li><li>15th February: Had a weekend break in Torquay.</li><li>2nd March : Took my son to his first North London derby.</li><li>3rd April: I used my spurs season ticket for the first time for the very first game at the new Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</li><li>22nd April: Went to Chessington for my Son's birthday!</li><li>26th April: I went to see an ENT specialist after putting up with sinus problems for years (despite nearly fainting at the hospital), I got steroids from him which have really helped my sinuses!</li><li>24th May: I went on holiday to St Ives in Cornwall with my Wife and my 2 youngest children. I felt bad on a couple of the days but enjoyed the time away.</li><li>4th June: Went with my wife to see Hugh Jackman at the O2.</li><li>14th June: Went to see Gazza and Vinnie Jones at the Oasis.</li><li>26th June: I shared another article on my mental health <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/its-okay-ok-andrew-boorman-fcca/" target="_blank">It's OK to not be OK!</a></li><li>23rd July: I was part of a presentation to our Group CFO on the UK IFRS 17 project.</li><li>6th August: Had a short break to the Lake District.</li><li>6th September: Met Ledley King at a Swindon Spurs legends night.</li><li>9th September: I change my working hours by compressing my full time hours into 4 days.</li><li>10th September: Booked a holiday to Florida for November 2020, just need to work on getting there unlike New York in 2018.</li><li>11th September: I made a post about suicide prevention which got a lot of comments and messages, which has led to making a new friend from around the world.</li><li>22nd September: Went on a mini-cruise but didn't see any of Belgium as I was in bed with a migraine.</li><li>26th September: Met Gary Mabutt at a Swindon Town legends night.</li><li>1st October: Delivered a training session on IFRS 17 to some senior finance execs.</li><li>23rd October: Went to London so my Son could go on the last remaining tube lines he needed to go on!</li><li>25th October: Went on a last minute break to Cornwall, wasn't feeling that great but spoke to my wife and she helped me deal with it!</li><li>13th November: Went to the cinema with my wife without the kids!</li><li>14th November: Helped deliver a training session on IFRS 17 to a number of finance team members.</li><li>Now no list from an accountant can be complete without some numbers so here are a few about the last 365 days: 10 visits to the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium gradually seeing worse performances each time luckily missing some of the worst performances through illness, an average of 2.5 visits to see a Doctor per month so much so the receptionists all know me well, getting to do the school run about 15% of the time, using our family national trust memberships to save over £300 on visits and parking and finally 4,048 deleted work emails since I have gone onto outlook!</li></ol>
<p>So what's next? I need to work on my anxiety around holidays and days out but looking back at this list is helpful in realising I can do all these things despite not being fully recovered from my mental health problems!</p>
<p>And remember if you don't feel OK please tell someone!</p>
<p>Thanks Andy</p>
